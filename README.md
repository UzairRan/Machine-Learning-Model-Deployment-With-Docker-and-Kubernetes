This repository shows how to deploy a simple machine learning model using Flask for the API, Docker for containerization, and Kubernetes for orchestration. A basic logistic regression model is included. It is accessible through a Flask REST API. The application is packaged in the Docker container, and Kubernetes ensures scalability and easy management of the deployment. Follow the instructions to build, test, and deploy the model on a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube.
